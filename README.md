eLPAS

The objective of the project was to build a low-cost active car suspension for use in emergency vehicles. The design was based on the principles of the eLPAS design for it's simplicity and costs. The design equations were simulated in MATLAB to choose some of the parameters and validate the design as a suspension. The components include a dsPIC33EP64MC202 microcontroller, Grainger 1LPV3 DC permanent magnet geared brushed motor, a distance sensor, an accelerometer, an optical encoder and a PC.
